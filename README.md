# Frontend for Hackathon Management System (HMS)

This project is built with Next.js and uses several modern development tools, including pre-commit hooks, Storybook for component development, and more. Below you'll find a guide on how to set up and run the project, along with instructions on adding stories for components and configuring necessary pre-commit hooks.

> Refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ComputerSocietyVITC/hms-frontend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting out development and working on the project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running:

1. **Fork the repository**

   Click the Fork button at the top right corner of the repository to create a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hms-frontend.git
   cd hms-frontend
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**

   Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

   Replace `your-feature-name` with a meaningful name that describes the feature you're working on.

4. **Install dependencies**

   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies for the project:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Prerequisites

Before setting up pre-commit hooks and Storybook, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm

If you don't have these installed, download and install them from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setting Up Pre-Commit Hooks

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality before each commit. Hereâ€™s how to set up the pre-commit hooks:

1. **Enable Husky**

   Husky needs to be enabled in your project. Run the following:

   ```bash
   npm run prepare
   ```

   This will install Husky hooks into your project, specifically the pre-commit hook that will run lint-staged before every commit.

2. **Configure lint-staged**

   Lint-staged is configured to run ESLint, Prettier, and other tools on staged files before commit. The configuration is already set in package.json as follows:

   ```json
   "lint-staged": {
    "**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ]
   }
   ```

## Building Components

This project uses shadcn/ui for building components. You don't need to install it separately as it's already included in the project dependencies.

To add a new component, you need to refer to the shadcn/ui documentation. For example, to add a button component, you can use the following code:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

This will add a new button component to the components directory. You can then import and use this component in the project.

You can add more components using the same command. Refer to the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) for more details.

For further development, you will need to pick up issues from the GitHub repository and work on them.

## Running the Project

Once everything is set up, you can run the project locally for development and production builds.

1. **Development**

   For running the project in development mode, use:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js development server, and you can view the project at http://localhost:3000.

2. **Build for Production**

   To build the project for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   After building, you can start the production server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will serve the app on http://localhost:3000 with optimized production code.

## Commit Guidelines

To maintain a clean and consistent commit history, follow these guidelines:

- **Branch Naming**: Use meaningful branch names that describe the feature or bug you're working on. For example, `feat/add-login-page` or `fix/fix-button-styling`.
- **Commit Messages**: Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes you've made. If you're fixing a bug, use `fix: bug description`. For adding a new feature, use `feat: feature description`. For refactoring, use `refactor: description`.
- **Always build before committing**: Make sure to run `npm run build` before committing your changes. This ensures that the code is error-free and builds successfully. Even though it will run automatically on a Pull Request, it's a good practice to run it locally.
- **Pull Requests**: Create a pull request for each feature or bug fix. Add a meaningful title and description to the PR. Assign reviewers and labels as needed.

## Conclusion

The project is built with Next.js, Husky (for pre-commit hooks), and Storybook (for component-driven development). Follow the steps in this README to set up your development environment, add component stories, and run the project locally.
